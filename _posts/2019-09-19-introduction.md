title: An Introduction
---

I'm James "degenerat3" Maskelony, a Computing Security student (for a few more months, at least) at Rochester Institute of Technology.  Over the last year or so I have found myself working on a various projects and diving down random rabbit holes in the security world.  I wanted a place to document the things that I'm doing, hopefully in a format that will spark interest and help others learn. This blog will be a collection of project descriptions, research into topics I find interesting, and anything else I want to share with the world.
