I'm James, a Security Analyst in DC Area and an alumni of Rochester Institute of Technology. My professional interests include IR, devops, red team tool development, and anything to do with elasticsearch.  I'm hoping to get a bit more into reverse engineering, binary exploitation, mostly through CTFs and other lab stuff.
